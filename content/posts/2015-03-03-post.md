Last fall I had some free time and decided to try my hand at game development again. I have been working in the mobile space for the past couple of years so I thought I'd leverage a language that was already in my daily rountine. So I went with JavaScript. I liked the idea of having the flexibility of running the game from a web browser and being able to run it natively with the help of a wrapper. I also was interested in seeing how one of these JavaScript gaming frameworks held up.  So, after a little research, I decided to go with [Phaser](http://phaser.io) for the framework and [CocoonJs](https://www.ludei.com/cocoonjs/) for the native wrapper.

For my first game I didn't want to get tied up with working on the graphics and design of the game so I decided to create a tribute to my favorite Atari 2600 game, [River Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Raid). The basic 8-bit graphics would keep it simple and the gameplay was complex enough that I would get to really test out the framework.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience and I plan on posting more details about the things I learned using Phaser and CocoonJs in the future.

But for now just check out the game details [here](http://lostleafstudio.com/river-raid-classic) or head over to the app store to pick up my game and start playing. 

Cheers!
