title: "How to add your profile photo to a page in Ghost"
---

I thought with the new year I should spruce up my online presence. So I decided a new site was in order. I've really enjoyed what I've seen with [Ghost](https://ghost.org) so I decided to have a go with it. It's been smooth sailing so far and I've come across a few tricks that I thought I should share one.

If you're interested in adding you profile photo to a page and/or template just do the following:

Add this html to the location where you want your profile image shown:

```html
<img
  src="{{#if posts.[0]}}{{posts.[0].author.image}}{{else}}{{post.author.image}}{{/if}}"
  class="profile-image"
  alt="My Profile Photo"
/>
```

Add this to your css file:

```css
.profile-image {
  position: relative;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 3px solid #fff;
  border-radius: 100%;
}
```

And if all went well you'll see the profile image similar to what you see on this site. Enjoy.
