title: Arduino powered LED Matrix
---

[![Video of LED Matrix](https://github.com/joshgerdes/arduino-led-matrix/blob/master/resources/images/LED_Matrix.gif?raw=true)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=froi3urcf1Y)

I have had this project sitting half complete on my desk for quite quite a few months. With the latest COVID-19 sheltering in fun we've been having, I finally found time to complete it.  And I'm pretty happy with the results.

The project is an Arduino powered 16x16 LED Matrix using the [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) library to drive a WS2812B LED array. This could be used to display a variety of fun light displays. I am currently using it to display a variety of classic arcade sprites.

It was a fun project to do and I'm thinking of leveraging this LED matrix concept to create some sort of interactive game in the future. And since I always appreciate it when people share the details on what was used in their projects and how it was made, I have tried to share the details as well. I hope someone finds it helpful.

Cheers!
