title: 'Pebble Watchapp: Premier League Scores'
---

I got a new Pebble watch for Christmas this year and I, of course, wanted to be able to keep up-to-date on the latest Premier League scores with this new gadget. But unfortunately there were not any good app options to make that happen. So, being the good developer that I am, I decided to just make an app myself. 

So here's the details:

This is a pebble.js watchapp for displaying today's English Premier League scores. Get up to the minute scores on the soccer/football matches happening today.
