With the latest COVID-19 sheltering in fun we&amp;rsquo;ve been having, I finally found time to complete it. And I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the results.
The project is an Arduino powered 16x16 LED Matrix using the FastLED library to drive a WS2812B LED array. This could be used to display a variety of fun light displays.</description></item></channel></rss>
