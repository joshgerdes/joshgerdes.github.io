I built a few little Otto robots for my kids to assemble and tool around with in the past. They were fun but had pretty limited mobility.
What I was interested in was something that could move. So, over the years, I have started (and not finished) an array of robot designs. From spider-like hexapods and quadrupeds to even dabbling with strandbeests.</description></item><item><title>Arduino powered LED Matrix</title><link>https://joshgerdes.com/2020/05/arduino-powered-led-matrix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshgerdes.com/2020/05/arduino-powered-led-matrix/</guid><description>I have had this project sitting half complete on my desk for quite quite a few months. With the latest COVID-19 sheltering in fun we&amp;rsquo;ve been having, I finally found time to complete it. And I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the results.
The project is an Arduino powered 16x16 LED Matrix using the FastLED library to drive a WS2812B LED array. This could be used to display a variety of fun light displays.</description></item></channel></rss>
