I built a few little Otto robots for my kids to assemble and tool around with in the past. They were fun but had pretty limited mobility.
What I was interested in was something that could move. So, over the years, I have started (and not finished) an array of robot designs. From spider-like hexapods and quadrupeds to even dabbling with strandbeests.</description></item></channel></rss>
