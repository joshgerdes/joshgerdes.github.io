We were both too lazy to go downstairs to get the pegboard to keep score, so being the nerd that I am, I popped open the app store and downloaded a cribbage scoring app.
We played and throughout the game I was continuely frustrated with the app and the UX interface it had for scoring.</description></item></channel></rss>
